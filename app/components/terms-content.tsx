            <strong>8. REFUELLING OPTIONS</strong>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Most Bristol vehicles come with a full take of gas, but that is not
        always the case. These are three refueling options.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If You do not purchase fuel from Bristol at the beginning of the your
          rental and You return the Vehicle with as much fuel as was in it when
          you received it, You will not pay Bristol a charge for fuel.
        </li>
        <li>
          If You do not purchase fuel from Bristol at the beginning of your
          rental and You return the Vehicle with less fuel than was in it when
          You received it, Bristol will charge You a fuel Charge and Service
          Charge at an applicable per-litre rate or per-kilometre driven rate as
          determined by Bristol. To calculate this Fuel Charge amount, Bristol
          multiplies the number of litres needed to refuel the fuel tank to the
          level it was at when You received the Vehicle, by the per-litre or per
          kilometre driven rate.
        </li>
        <li>
          If You choose to purchase fuel from Bristol at the beginning of your
          rental by selecting the fuel purchase option, You will be charged as
          shown on the rental Agreement for that purchase. If You choose this
          option. You will not incur an additional fuel and service charge, but
          You will not receive any credit for fuel left in the tank at the time
          of return.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The cost of refuelling the vehicle yourself at the local service station
        will generally be lower than Bristol&apos;s fuel and service charge and
        the fuel purchase option. However, the fuel and service charge and the
        fuel purchase option allow for the convenience of not having to stop and
        refuel the vehicle prior to return.
      </p>
