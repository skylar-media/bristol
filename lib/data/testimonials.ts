      "This was great beginning to end. The Nassau St location found me the specific box truck I needed when no one else could get one, was easy to pickup/drop-off, and clarified the damage waiver options which helped on a very busy day for me. And the truck was very good. Not the biggest place but one of the best I've used!",

      "Super quick and easy. Great to work with this company if you're looking for a rental in the city. Everything promised was delivered. One more thing to note, this is a 100% Canadian owned company and in this new climate, they will definitely get my all my business in the future.",
